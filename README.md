# Apex pyReader

My friends and I like to track our Apex Legends stats (kills, damage, character used, and weapons used per round).

We have been manually typing in the data after each round, but with this script, I can take a screenshot of the final screens and the script inputs that data for the 3 of us in the respective places in the google sheet.

There are some issues currently, but working through them is the fun part!
